# N-body Sim 

This code is a small part of my undergraduate thesis project that studies interactions between galaxies and the formation of tidal features. 

## Abstract 
This work seeks to explore the formation of tidal features in disk galaxies. Specifically, the formation of tidal tails and arms due to the passage of a companion of equal or lesser mass. 
Towards this aim, a simplistic suite of simulation is developed based on the assumptions made in Toomre and Toomre's 1972 paper. Results are also gathered using higher resolution NEMO simulations. 
It is observed that tidal arms are formed by a perturber with mass >25 %  the galaxy's mass. Bridges and tails are observed to form for perturbs >50 % of the galaxy's mass. 
In the case of an equal mass companion, it is observed that for a close passage thin tails of stars are formed and the central stellar distributions of the two galaxies merge. 
These results are then compared to observational optical images of mass analogues; NGC5195,with companion M51 and NGC2623. Uncertanties in the Verlet estimation method allow only a qualitative study of the phenomenon 
but agreement is found between the results of this work, optical images and the literature surrounding the subject.Future work should include the verification of results using full hydrodynamic simulations.
